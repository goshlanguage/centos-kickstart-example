This project assumes that you already have a PXE Boot server installed on your network. 
In order to utilize this kickstart configuration file, you will need to modify your pxelinux.cfg file 
so that your append line includes a link to your kickstart.cfg file. 

Example:

LABEL 1
        MENU LABEL CentOS 6.4 (64-bit) Unattended 
        KERNEL images/centos/x86_64/6.4/vmlinuz
        APPEND initrd=images/centos/x86_64/6.4/initrd.img ks=http://192.168.1.2/kickstart.cfg
